## Data conversion workflow:

The following notebooks were used to update DMF hydrolysis parameter data:

1. vol_to_mol.ipynb contains code to convert acid volume to mols.
2. water_from_acid.ipynb contains code to update water contribution from aqueous acids. 
3. pKa.ipynb contains code to update pKa values of acids.
